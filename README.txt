Created EmployeeSQL folder on my local repository. I saved the csv files in a data folder in EmployeeSQL. Additionally, I created a folder for the ERD diagram
and for the SQL code (Table Schema and Queries). I created my Entity Relationship Diagram on https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ and exported the code.
I copied this code and ran it in PGAdmin. After running the code, I imported the data into the created tables. Once I had the tables, I was able to run
the various queries to answer the 8 questions for this homework.

Please reach out to me (email on BootCampSpot submission) if you have any questions!
